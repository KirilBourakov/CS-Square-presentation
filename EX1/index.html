        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        Text outside of elements will be displayed, but it's best 
        not to do this.
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>

        <div>
            <h2>This is a secondary heading</h2>
            <p>The heading, and these paragraphs, are within a div.</p>
            <p>Another paragraph.</p>
        </div>

        <h7>7th heading (not a real element), so it is ignored</h7>
